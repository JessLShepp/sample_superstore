This project comes from the sample_superstore dataset in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/sample_-_superstore.xls).  
I have included basic analysis functions such as sumifs, count, pivot tables, pivot charts and more. 
The project will be updated as I add more functions and elements to the workbook.
